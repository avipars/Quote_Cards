## Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle build system.  To build this project, clone and use 
"Import Project" in Android Studio. Set up firebase ads using this tutorial - https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/admob-firebase and add the ad unit in strings.xml under banner_ad_unit_id

Make sure that you have added *google-services.json* while integrating Firebase ads and placed it inside app directory.
After all the above steps are done your good to go :smile:
